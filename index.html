                <p class="text-light fade-in-right">My name is Dante Proto. I was born December 6th, 1994 in Mesa, AZ. I
                    currently
                    live in Queen Creek, AZ, where I grew up. In my younger years, I attended St. Timothy's Catholic
                    Academy
                    1st through 6th grade. I went to a public school for the first time in the 7th grade at Payne
                    Jr. High. It
                    was around this time when I started playing my favorite sport, American Football. After football
                    season, I
                    became
                    a wrestler. My Jr. High sports career prepared me for High
                    School level
                    competition.
                    I had a very successful Freshman football season. I moved up to the Junior Varsity level, which
                    ended up
                    being where my
                    football career ended. I do miss the field, but football politics ruined the game for me. I did
                    wrestle all 4 years of high school,
                    although I was
                    injury prone
                    my first 3 years in highschool. I did have a very good varsity comeback my senior year, and barely
                    missed my chance at
                    going to the
                    state
                    wrestling tournament(by 3 points). Sports taught me a lot about discipline, work ethic, and how to
                    be a part of a team.</p>

                    After highschool, I wanted to be a mechanical engineer due to
                    inspiration
                    from my neighbor. I quickly realized that
                    calculus was a big part of engineering, and it was my least favorite class in college. I switced
                    my major to
                    General
                    Business after my first year of college. I have been working towards becoming an accountant. I
                    have not
                    obtained a degree
                    in business yet. However, I did study part time for 3 years while working fast food at Panda
                    Express, and
                    later working
                    retail at Costco. I was unable to promote to a full time position at Costco due to seniority,
                    however, I did
                    realize I
                    enjoyed learning
                    about new technology. I was a sales representative in the electronics section before I left
                    Costco to drive Uber and Lyft full time. It was fun for awhile, however, the hours are hard, and
                    the wear
                    and tear on
                    your vehicle really adds up over time. I landed a job with Dish Network as a Customer Service
                    representative. I handled
                    customer service calls until I was later promoted to technical support. I then handled a mix of
                    tech and
                    customer service
                    calls. As delightful as phone calls may be, I decided that they were not for me, and I was
                    thinking about
                    quitting Dish to do something else before
                    Chat Support came to our site. I was a part of the first 2 chat teams that were created at the
                    Phoenix
                    location. I now
                    handle a mix of tech and customer service chats. I enjoy chat support a lot
                    more than
                    phone calls,
                    as it seems to be more efficient, and I can be more descriptive to help the customer to the best
                    of my
                    ability.</p>

                <p>The only problem with my job at Dish is there is not a whole lot of opportunity to advance through
                    chat. That is why I am
                    currently
                    attending UA Coding
                    Bootcamp, to obtain my certificate in Full Stack Web Development. I love writing code, and have
                    worked hard on this page to display my new skills. I have used Bootstrap, and my own CSS on this
                    page. I have added some animations using a cool website called Animista. Feel free to check out my
                    GitHub page to see more of my work. I hope to find a new career
                    in web development before or right after graduating this course. I am very excited to start a new
                    career, and continue learning more and more about web development on the front end and back end
                    side.</p>
