                <p class="text-light fade-in-right">My name is Dante Proto. I was born December 6th, 1994 in Mesa, AZ. I
                    currently
                    live in Queen Creek, AZ, where I grew up. I attended St. Timothy's Catholic
                    Academy for elementary school. I went to a public school for the first time in the 7th grade at
                    Payne
                    Jr. High. It
                    was around this time when I started playing my all time favorite sport, American Football. After
                    football
                    season, I
                    started practicing in the art of Roman Greco wrestling. My Jr. High sports career prepared
                    me for High
                    School level
                    competition.
                    I had a very successful Freshman football season. I moved up to the Junior Varsity level, which
                    ended up
                    being where my
                    football career ended. There is not a day that goes by that I do not miss playing! I did
                    wrestle all 4 years of high school, and had a phenomenal varsity season! I barely
                    missed my chance at
                    going to the
                    state
                    wrestling tournament(by 3 points) in the sectional finals. Sports taught me a lot about discipline,
                    work ethic, and how to
                    be a part of a team. I also showed livestock starting at 9 years old until I was 18 years old. One
                    of my greatest accomplishments was winning Reserve Grand Champion for my market hog. </p>

                    After highschool, I wanted to be a mechanical engineer due to
                    inspiration
                    from my neighbor. I quickly realized that
                    calculus was a big part of engineering, and it was my least favorite class in college. I switced
                    my major to
                    General
                    Business after my first year of college. I have been working towards becoming an accountant for some
                    years now. I
                    have not
                    obtained a degree
                    in business yet. However, I did study part time for 3 years while working fast food at Panda
                    Express, and
                    later working
                    retail at Costco. I worked in Front End operations, and I was a sales representative in the
                    electronics department before I left
                    Costco to drive Uber and Lyft full time. It was fun for awhile, however, the hours are hard to work,
                    and
                    the wear
                    and tear on
                    your vehicle really adds up over time. I do have some wonderful stories though! I landed a job with
                    Dish Network as a Customer Service
                    representative. I handled
                    customer service calls until I was later promoted to technical support. I then handled a mix of
                    tech and
                    customer service
                    calls. I was excited when chat became an opportunity at Dish. I was a part of the first 2 chat teams
                    that were created at the
                    Phoenix
                    location. I
                    handled a mix of tech and customer service chats. I enjoy chat support a lot
                    more than
                    phone calls,
                    as it seems to be more efficient, and I can be more descriptive to help the customer to the best
                    of my
                    ability. Chat has since closed at our location, and I am now a Fulfillment agent. I schedule
                    technicians and order parts for Samsung Appliance repair, as we are an authorized service provider.

                <p>I am now looking to advance into a better paying career, that not only pays the bills, but that I
                    enjoy! I have been attending UA Coding
                    Bootcamp, to obtain my certificate in Full Stack Web Development. I am through the Front End portion
                    of my course, and I am half way through the entire course. I have experience with HTML5, CSS,
                    JavaScript, JQuery, Firebase DB, SQL and My SQL DB, Node.js, and using API's from multiple sources.
                    I love writing code, and have
                    worked hard on this page to display my new skills. I have used Bootstrap, and my own CSS on this
                    page. I have added some animations using an awesome website called Animista. I plan to continue
                    adding more to this page, and would like to write some functionality for it to better display my
                    skills. If
                    you click the
                    Portfolio button, you will see many of my projects that I have completed, and that I am working on.
                    Feel free to check out
                    my
                    GitHub page by clicking the GitHub icon at the top of my page, or on the footer of my page to see
                    more of my work. I hope to find a new career
                    in web development before or right after graduating this course. I am currently looking for Front
                    End Developer positions. You can find my contact info by clicking the Contact button at the top of
                    my page. I also have my resume linked to that page, as well as my LinkedIn profile. I am very
                    excited to start a new
                    career, and continue learning more and more about Web Development on the Front End and Back End
                    side. </p>
