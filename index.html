                <p class="text-light fade-in-right">My name is Dante Proto. I was born December 6th, 1994 in Mesa, AZ. I currently
                    live in Queen Creek, AZ, where I grew up. In my younger years, I attended St. Timothy's Catholic
                    Academy
                    1st through 6th grade. I went to a public school for the first time in the 7th grade at Payne
                    Jr. High. It
                    was around this time when I started playing my favorite sport, American Football. After football
                    season, I
                    became
                    a wrestler following in my father's footsteps. My Jr. High sports career prepared me for High
                    School level
                    competition.
                    I had a very successful Freshman football season. I moved up to the Junior Varsity level, which
                    ended up
                    being where my
                    football career ended due to illness, and injury. I did wrestle all 4 years of high school,
                    although I was
                    injury prone
                    my first 3 years in highschool. I was contending with Mono as well, which also ruined my Junior
                    Varsity
                    football
                    career. I did have a very good varsity comeback my senior year, and barely missed my chance at
                    going to the
                    state
                    wrestling tournament(by 3 points).</p>

                    After highschool, I wanted to be a mechanical engineer due to
                    inspiration
                    from my neighbor. I quickly realized that
                    calculus was a big part of engineering, and it was my least favorite class in college. I switced
                    my major to
                    General
                    Business after my first year of college. I have been working towards becoming an accountant. I
                    have not
                    obtained a degree
                    in business yet. However, I did study part time for 3 years while working fast food at Panda
                    Express, and
                    later working
                    retail at Costco. I was unable to promote to a full time position at Costco, however, I did
                    realize I
                    enjoyed learning
                    about new technology. I was a sales representative in the electronics section before I left
                    Costco to drive Uber and Lyft full time. It was fun for awhile, however, the hours are hard, and
                    the wear
                    and tear on
                    your vehicle really adds up over time. I landed a job with Dish Network as a Customer Service
                    representative. I handled
                    customer service calls until I was later promoted to technical support. I then handled a mix of
                    tech and
                    customer service
                    calls. As delightful as phone calls may be, I decided that they were not for me, and I was
                    thinking about
                    quitting Dish before
                    Chat Support came to our site. I was a part of the first 2 chat teams that were created at the
                    Phoenix
                    location. I now
                    handle a mix of tech and customer service chats, up to two at a time. I enjoy chat support a lot
                    more than
                    phone calls,
                    as it seems to be more efficient, and I can be more descriptive to help the customer to the best
                    of my
                    ability.</p>

                <p>The only issue with chat is there is not a lot of room to grow, and promote. That is why I am
                    currently
                    attending UA Coding
                    Bootcamp, to learn about writing code, and using code in real life applications. I also would
                    love to
                    advance
                    to a point where I can make websites, and applications of my own. I hope to find a new career
                    with Dish,
                    or a better opportunity with my new coding knowledge, pending the completion of the Bootcamp. I
                    am excited
                    and eager to
                    learn as much as I can about code!</p>
